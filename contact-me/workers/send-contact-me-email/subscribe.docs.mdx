Cloudflare Workers are serverless applications most often used to intercept and modify network requests (much like Service Workers in the browser).

This CF Worker sets a function to be triggered on a 'post' event. The function returns a [Response](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/response),
containing a message..

## To edit the worker follow these steps:

- Configure the app in the workspace.json file.

```
 "cohen-codes.contact-me/workers/send-contact-me-email": {},
```

- Edit `subscribe/.cf-worket.ts` file with your credentials.

- Edit the `subscribe.app-root.ts` file to add your logic.

- Tag the component. Don't forget to add the token as an env variable.

```
bit tag teambit.newsletter/workers/subscribe
```
